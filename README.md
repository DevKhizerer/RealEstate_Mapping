# Real Estate Mapping Project üè°üìä

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive real estate mapping project. The project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset of properties, creating detailed visualizations, and mapping the results using interactive tools.

## Project Description

The project is divided into several key phases:

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç
   - **Data Acquisition**: A comprehensive dataset of real estate properties was collected. This dataset includes various attributes such as location, price, size, and type of property.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration was conducted to understand the dataset's structure and identify key variables. This involved:
     - **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
     - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures.
     - **Visualization**: Creating scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to uncover trends and patterns in the data.

2. **In-Depth Data Analysis** üî¨üìà
   - **Advanced Visualization**: Developed a series of scatterplots and other visualizations to delve deeper into property attributes and their relationships. Key analyses include:
     - **Price vs. Size**: Analyzing the correlation between property price and size.
     - **Location Analysis**: Examining geographic distribution of properties and identifying hotspots.
     - **Trend Analysis**: Investigating temporal trends and patterns in property prices.

3. **Interactive Mapping** üó∫Ô∏èüåê
   - **Folium Integration**: Utilized Folium to create interactive maps displaying property locations and attributes. The interactive map includes:
     - **Markers**: Custom markers to represent individual properties.
     - **Popups**: Detailed information about each property accessible through popups.
     - **Layer Control**: Options to toggle different layers for enhanced data visualization.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**:
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
  - **Folium**: Interactive mapping.
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and documentation.
- **Data Sources**: [Include information on data sources if available]

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis or extend the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-mapping.git
   cd real-estate-mapping
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Execute `data_preparation.py` to clean and preprocess the data.
   - **Exploratory Analysis**: Run `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` to perform initial EDA and generate visualizations.
   - **In-Depth Analysis**: Execute `in_depth_analysis.py` for advanced data analysis and scatterplots.
   - **Interactive Mapping**: Use `interactive_map.py` to generate and view the interactive Folium map.
